# NoWasteSite
This website connects food providers with the people in need.
Such inspiratino came from the observation of the current situation in Canada,
and specifically Montreal. Where people are going to the food banks in the millions
across the country, and only the luck ones are able to get what they need.
## Featuers
- The website has a JSON database.
- Uses JS and AJAX to make the web pages interactive
